# Pubg Winner Prediction
# PUBG Winner Prediction using Random Forest Regressor Model

## Overview:
This project aims to predict the winner of a PUBG (PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds) match using a machine learning model based on Random Forest Regression. PUBG is a popular online multiplayer battle royale game where players fight to be the last one standing. By utilizing historical match data, this model predicts which player or team is likely to win a match based on various game metrics.

## Dataset:
The dataset “pubg.csv” used for training and testing the model contains information about PUBG matches, including player statistics, match characteristics, and match outcomes.

## Model Evaluation:
- The performance of the Random Forest Regressor model can be evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared score.
- Cross-validation techniques can also be employed to assess the model's robustness and generalization ability.

## Results:
- Provide insights into the model's predictive performance.
- Include visualizations or summary statistics to illustrate the model's accuracy and efficacy in predicting PUBG match winners.
